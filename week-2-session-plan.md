13:00 NODE SESSION BEGINS

Form pairs
DL repo

run mocha test.spec.js in the api directory
you should see this: screenshot
what does that mean?
follow the errors
any hints and tips with following TDD? - read the error message, google it, so on
a quick definition of TDD is probably too distracting (can tell them after that they've been doing TDD)
what do we need to explain - what supertest is? do they even need to look into the test file yet? nope.
can link back to the materials from last week for the points that they are going to have to go through.
I think the bare minimum, plus a read more section
once all the tests are passing you should see this: screenshots of green ticks
now run it on port 8080 and try it out in the browser / postman / curl

now go into the client-side repo and run the tests (could make this step harder - maybe this one with no package.json)
(can we test drive this?)
they need a controller. one route, with parameters. - how do we unit test this?
how to set up a templating engine (and which one? they used mustachebefore)
how to fetch data (async) isomorphic-fetch, from the api running at localhost:8080
how to render data into a view
how to access data from a template

16:00 fundamentals recap - what is node? and game

make sure everyone is asked a direct question

17:30 Set homework, quick retro, go home
